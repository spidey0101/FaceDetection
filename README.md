# Real-Time Face Detection with Haar Cascades

This project shows how to detect faces in real-time using Python and OpenCV's Haar cascades. Haar cascades are a type of algorithm that can find objects in images, like faces.

## How to Use

1. **Installation**: First, download or copy this project to your computer. Then, open your terminal and install the required libraries by typing:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Program**: Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and run the following command:
   ```
   python face_detection.py
   ```
   This will start the program and open your webcam. It will detect faces in the video stream in real-time.

## What You Need

- **OpenCV (cv2)**: OpenCV is a library that helps with image and video processing. We're using it here to detect faces using Haar cascades.
